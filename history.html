		<h1>The History & Future behind the spinning...</h1>
		</div>
			<div class="hist">
				<p>The sport originates from a time when spinning was associated with gangsters in South Africa.<br>
				Gangsters from apartheid's racially segregated townships who stole cars to make ends meet<br>
				and showed off their bounty by performing wild stunts in the streets.<br>
				The sport reached the peak during the years 1980's.<br>
				<br>
				The name "Gusheshe" nickname refers to BMW E30 hard-top 325iS.
				<br>Manufactured between 1982 and 1994.<br>
				The E30 series comprises a range of vehicles, 
				<br>from the 316 and 318 to the 325i, 323 and the 325is.<br>
				<br>
				The year 1985 saw the introduction of one of the most brutally contested race series in South Africa: group N for production vehicles.
				It became clear that the e30 M3 would not be coming to SA due to its left-hand drive production and we got the 325iS instead.
				This car gained immense popularity as well as notoriety over the decades<br>
				having been used as the getaway car of choice in many a heist 
				BMW claimed a 0-100 time of 7.5 seconds and a top speed of just over 225km/h
				which was quite something for its time.<br>
				The Gusheshe has become popular in the local “spinning” scene, too
				because of its rear-wheel drive layout and easily controllable nature while doing doughnuts and burnouts.
				It is hailed as the car of all cars among local drag racers and car fanatics in Mzansi for its spinning racing and drifting capabilities. 
				<br>
				Recently the South African hip-hop scene has come out with tracks mentioning the cult classic, 
				Cassper Nyovest had Gusheshe ft Okmaloomkoolkat and rapper Sheen Skaiz did Gusheshe Versace Freestyle.
				<br>
				With the growth of the sport, it is evident that the is a love for spinning that is so GREAT and paving the way. <br>
				<br>
				We have a 20-year-old female, dominating the scene and competiting amongst the greats. <br>
				Stacy-Lee May drives a pink 325 and along with Trina. We also have boys from the age of 6-years-old as spinners.
				Jean “Panjero” Kruger, 14 is not your average boy-next-door, is as boyish as they come but wait till he gets behind the wheel of his “Gusheshe”<br>
				He joined the adrenaline-pumping township motor sport two years ago and has become the top spinner and leader of his team.
				The power to thrill runs in the blood of the Kruger boys. His 16-year-old brother, Austin “Powers”.
				It is through this sport, we are able to keep child of streets and away from bad influences. The amount of competitions and price-giving,<br>
				THE YOUNG STARS ARE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE AND BRIGHTER FUTURE.</p>
